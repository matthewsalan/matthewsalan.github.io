        <p>TL;DR, I am a: junior Rails developer, bartender, Liverpool FC fan (YNWA!!), reformed recording engineer, lover of tech, brother, uncle, introvert, Scorpio, gym rat!
        <br />
        <br />

        I'm pretty hopeless when it comes to describing myself, but here is a little about me. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I was born in Jacksonville, Florida.  I am the youngest of three boys and I grew up playing sports.  I even played ice hockey, yes in Florida.  My college experience was unique.  I went to two completely different schools, struggling to find a career I could be passionate about.  I have a bachelor's degree from the University of North Florida in Community Health.  What's that you might ask?  Long story....I also have an associate's degree in Recording Arts from Full Sail University.  I know I know, huh?  I wanted to dj since the seventh grade (when I saw my first pair of real life SL-1200's!!) and dabbled with it some years later.  Music pushed me to forgo a nursing career (the whole B.S. in Community Health thing), which brings me to now...
        <br />
        <br />
        I moved to Atlanta in 2010 and have been pursuing a career in the recording industry since (while moonlighting as a bartender).  These past few years have been the toughest I've experienced so far in my life, but also have taught me a great deal.  I've met some famous Atlanta artists as well as a famous French house DJ (ask me about a story involvoing food allergies and said dj).  As you might expect, getting a job in the music industry is not easy!  
        <br />
        <br />
        At the moment I am in the process of a career change.  I'm moving into the web development field and just finished training at The Iron Yard (learning Ruby on Rails).  I am super excited about this journey and looking forward to starting my first job!  I've always loved tech and have used a computer since a young age.

        Wow! You made it this far!  I trust my story was compelling and worth your time.  Feel free to browse my portfolio and experience if you want to know more about my work.
