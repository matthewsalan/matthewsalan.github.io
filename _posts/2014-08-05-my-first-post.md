Catalytic Converters and Being Lost In The Woods
================

  So, you might be wondering what I'm talking about with the above statement
and how they are connected.  Like most things in life it's a long story, but one
that I am going to share with you.

  I woke up this past Saturday morning and got into my truck to drive to go to my
new school, The Iron Yard.  I am taking their back-end web development course,
focusing on Ruby and Ruby on Rails.  Coding, software engineering, web development,
which ever you want to cal it, is all brand new to me.  To say that I am
struggling to learn my craft would be putting it lightly.  But, back to my
truck.

  I started the engine and was gifted with the glorious sound of an open exhaust.
I've been a car guy all of my life, even spent my time doing some maybe not so
legal drag racing, so to a certain extent I am used to hearing cars with little
in the way of muffling.  Hearing the roaring exhaust sound emanating from truck
was not what I expected to hear and sent me into a panic.  I quickly turned offthe engine and jumped out of the cab.  I went to go look under the hood but
thought better and looked underneath my truck at the exhaust.  There I found
a section of the exhaust pipe cut out and realized that someone had made off with my
catalytic converter.  

  Once the shock wore off, I started to ask reasonable questions like why would
someone steal such a thing and what profit a stolen catalytic converter can
fetch.  Upon doing some Google research, I found out that catalytic converters
have small amounts of platinum.  The going rate for a gram of platinum is
$50 dollars.  My Google search also revealed that Atlanta is a hot bed of stolen
catalytic converters, which jives with Atlanta having a high property crime rate
and the two other times my truck has been broken into.

  So I spent my Saturday in a fruitless effort to get my exhaust fixed.  The
cheapest route to fixing my truck was ordering the parts and fixing it myself.
My wallet was soon $400 dollar lighter and I went to go study.  Which leads me
back to the whole being lost in the woods thing.

  Learning to code has been quite demoralizing and humbling.  The course I am
taking is intense and I am just not getting it at the moment.  I am not used to
being way behind everyone else and it's not a fun feeling.  Perhaps after only
a few days I am being to hard on myself but I am so lost in figuring everything
out, I am not sure how I am progressing.  Not to mention some moron decided to
vandalize my truck which has caused me to waste time in order to fix it.  They
say time is money and in this case it's worth $400 dollars.  I wasted time I
wanted to spend studying to get out of the woods, which could affect my future
earnings.  Maybe the Freakonomics guys could do some weird study about stolen car
parts and loss of future income?

  Or maybe I'd still be lost in the big bad coding forest if nothing happened
to my truck.  In any case, blaming the thief makes me feel better!

  Oh yeah, one more thing.  That new catalytic converter I bought, it doesn't fit
my truck.
