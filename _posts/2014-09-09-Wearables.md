The Search For a Game Changer Continues
================

The Apple unveil of the new iPhone's and Apple Watch has come and gone.  They are starting to become old hat, but I was looking forward to this event more than past product launches.  Obviously there are two new iPhone's, but with the leaks on the internet about the new phones, there was little to be surprised about.  The product that really had my interest was the watch that was in the pipeline.  Wearables are the current buzz in tech but have yielded almost nothing in terms of a useful end user product.

Google Glass is, in my opinion, the only real out of the box idea for a futuristic wearable.  Being able to read texts, get navigation directions, notifications, record video, take pictures, etc. from Glass is really awesome to me.  It's also incredibly creepy, dorky, and privacy invading.  The term Glasshole was even coined to define the people who wear them.  It's obvious Google had no real intention of making Glass a mainstream product, but more of a springboard to bigger and better things.  Google isn't a stranger making moonshot products as <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/04/15/project-ara-modular-smartphone/" target="blank"> Project Ara shows.  </a>  I think Google should really be applauded for these kinds of projects that are innovative and push current hardware to the limit.  Which brings me to the Apple Watch.

Apple being a heavy hitter in the tech arena, and one that really concerns itself with design, I was looking forward to what they had to offer with their watch.  As far as looks go, I love it.  It's Apple design through and through. They just forgot the innovative part.  Sending someone my heartbeat, unlocking my hotel room with my watch, sending a finger drawn picture?

The health tracking features are great, but then it makes the Apple Watch an overblown Fuel Band or Fit Bit.  Also, are people really THAT concerned with tracking how many steps they took in a day?  The Apple Pay with NFC (NFC which Apple had to be carried kicking and screaming into the future with) is the only real thing that has any traction in my opinion, but that integrates with the NFC on the new iPhone and Touch ID for security.  

The watch just seems so similar to it's Android counterparts the Moto 360 and Samsung Gear 2.  All awesome to look at but ultimately an accessory rather than a new innovative product.  Apple also seemed to take a page from Samsung's play book and stuff it with useless software features, leaving it feeling cluttered.  It's strange coming from a company that brought us the iPhone and iPad, two game changers.  

Wearables are yet to make an impact and more than likely won't anytime soon.  They have to strike a balance of form and function that people will want to wear.  Google Glass is too over the top for now and a watch is too underwhelming. Also, I haven't owned a watch in a long time and there is a younger generation that has probably never wore one.  Which is why I wished Apple would have brought a little more Google like adventure and present a wearable that may not be consumer ready, but would shake things up.  Wearables need to replace something or make us want something that we didn't know we needed.  I'm still waiting...................
