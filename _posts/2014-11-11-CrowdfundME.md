Dear loyal readers,
==================


I need your help!  If you haven't heard the news yet, I'll be pursing a little career/life change in January.  A new year and new me will begin with <a href="http://theironyard.com">The Iron Yard</a> and their Rails Engineering program.  I am really excited about my new career/life and I can't wait to get started.   As I am sure you have read my <a href="http://alanmatthews.net/jekyll/update/2014/08/05/my-first-post.html"> previous blog post</a> about my first time going to The Iron Yard, I won't rehash too much.  <a href="http://alanmatthews.net/jekyll/update/2014/08/19/Wait-Pause.html">Unfortunately I had to withdraw from the course</a> due to personal reasons, but I am back for round two and better than ever!  I've spent a lot of time, and will continue, studying and getting prepared for school in January.  

This is where you come in lovely reader!  I could use a little help getting through the three months I'll be learning the web development trade.  Due to the nature of the program at The Iron Yard, I won't be able to work full time and I am looking to avoid having to borrow money from a lender.  So, I've decided to reach out to family, friends, and strangers alike to ask your help and donate to my cause.  I've started a <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/alan_codeschoolfun">crowdfunding campaign here</a>, and any help you can give will be truly appreciated!!  No donation is too small and will go along way to changing my life.  I am happy to return the favor with my newly minted skills for any who donate and are in need of my services.  


Thanks in advance and help me spread the word!
