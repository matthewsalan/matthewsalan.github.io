Time flies when your at a dev bootcamp....
==================================

Okay, so maybe I lied about the whole no more self loathing/whining blog posts, but one more won't hurt!  Plus it's Friday.  Haven't taken the time to blog in a while either so I'll catch you up on things.

Somehow I believe in the span of my last post and now, we have covered the MVC architecture behind Rails.  It feels just like yesterday that I was drowning in just good old plain Ruby!  It's been over four weeks since I started at The Iron Yard and it feels like much longer.  I'm proud I've made it this far, but the struggle has been real.

I recently spoke to a fellow student who is in a similar position that I was in during the last Rails course.  She is in the Front End course and talked about how overwhelming things have been for her.  It's not just simply learning the software stacks of your chosen development field, but learning many of the auxiliary pieces that go along with Rails, Swift, or Javascript.  Git, GitHub, command line, going to meetups, learning your text editor, OS X, etc. can be hurdles on your way to the finish line.  If you don't have previous experience coming in with these, you will end up fighting your tools that are supposed to aid you in your journey.  Throw in the uneasiness of being in a new environment (at least for introverts like me) and it can be quite daunting.  Struggling to move around on the command line just doesn't help any.  I spent today getting help with HTML/CSS from one of the other Front End students.  After feeling somewhat competent with Ruby/Rails (only sort of!), it was an awful feeling to be back at square one with front end technologies.  I actually found myself yearning for models and migrations, to be swimming in the seas of controllers and routes of which I know nothing about! 

Learning new things that are completely outside of the realm of what you have learned in the past has been tough.  Pushing through day after day, feeling like your failing at everything because you don't know all of these things is grueling.  I know I'm learning and that I'll get better but it doesn't make it any easier.  Don't get me started on reading the Ruby docs!  

The girl I spoke of earlier has decided to withdraw and defer to the next course.  She asked about what I did during the time leading up to the start of this cohort.  I told her that I spent a lot of time self studying on Treehouse and other resources.  It helped a lot since it covered some core Ruby/Rails, as well as Git,databases, and command line tutorials.  All of which are great to help prepare but it doesn't get you truly ready for the bootcamp experience.  Growing pains are required.
