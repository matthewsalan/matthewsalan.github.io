Hold That Thought
================


So my web development career is over before it really got started.  Perhaps I'm being a touch melodramatic, but hey, were all entitled to feel like the end of the world is happening every now and then.  I had to withdraw from the course I was taking due to some personal reasons.  In reality I am deferring to take the course again in January, which could end up being a blessing in disguise.  I tell myself that to cover up the disappointment because I am very much an instant gratification person (who isn't?).  I've put a lot of time, reseach, and effort into exploring web development as a career.  Usually I'm not the type to rush into things.  I take my time, investigate (introverted Scorpio at work!!), and try and to learn as much as I can about whatever I'm looking into.  Searching for things on the web is a hobby of mine.  The things you can learn and find by jumping from one website to another is awesome.  That is part of the reason why web development appeals so much to me, I think it would be awesome make a web application that people will use and be able to say that I made that.

Being made to wait is a bitter pill to swollow.  But as they say, Rome wasn't built in a day.  Don't worry dear readers, all two of you, I'll be spending my time studying and getting ready for the course in January.  The first two weeks were really tough and I was struggling.  Having some time now to review and get ready for Januray will be invaluable.  In the grand scheme of things, four months isn't really that long to wait for a career I want.  Life is a difficult mistress!!
