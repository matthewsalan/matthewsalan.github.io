But that's okay?.....
================


So, week two is done at the The Iron Yard.  Among the highlights, we explored classes, modules and scoping.  All of these concepts deserve their own time and place to explore thoroughly, but we've ran through them in just a few days.  I won't be going on a deep technical dive on these subjects, primarily because I don't completely understand them!  At some point in the near future I'm sure I'll veer off on some rant about programming, but that day is not today!

Every Friday we have group meetings with other students to talk about how everyone is feeling about the courses so far.  It's been a good avenue to vent about some of the frustrations you are having.  It's even better hearing the stories from other people having the same issues and struggles.  I keep thinking that the instructors/faculty are going to realize that I'm not good at this and kick me out, the impostor found!  My fumbling questions and blank screen where code should a clear sign that I don't belong here and I'll never be good at this!

We were asked at our Friday group meetings what has surprised us most about the school so far.  I mentioned that I was surprised to find that there were so many people here who had backgrounds in computers/programming already.  I was certain that it would all be people like me, bartender turned hacker!, who were making career changes.  Mostly that's been the case, but there are a fair amount of people who are pretty advanced.  It's been interesting to hear what they think of the courses so far, a lot of them stating that they have done more in two weeks here than entire semesters at traditional schools and that this stuff is hard.  Hearing this has been a big help to me and my impostor syndrome to say the least.  I should realize that I've accomplished a lot in this short time, but mostly I feel like.....

I promise that one day I'll stop with the self loathing blog posts!

I listened to a podcast last night that gave me some inspiration.  The series is hosted by <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/"> thoughtbot </a> and it's called Reboot, which interviews people who have made career changes into development.  The podcast I listened to had a guest on who had some what of a similar background to myself, trying to work in the film industry (me: recording industry) while working as a bartender/server (me: me too!) to pay the bills.  We came to the development career path in different ways, but the interview highlighted that what I'm doing is not impossible.  

Completely off topic, the door knob to the front door of my apartment fell off the other day as I tried to open it, leading me to have to break into my own apartment while standing out in the cold and rain.  This is totally in keeping with bizarre things that happen to me during the first weeks of being at The Iron Yard.  If you remember last time some clown stole the catalytic converter from my truck.


To end things on a high note, I re-worked some previous homework last night.  I was able to complete it without having to look anything up or ask for help!  It was really simple but I'll take it!  Baby steps....
