![Me](http://s29.postimg.org/z6ytwkz13/Alan_Matthews_small.png)

I'm pretty hopeless when it comes to describing myself, but here is a little about me.  Skip to the bottom for the quick version!

I was born in Jacksonville, Florida.  I am the youngest of three boys and I grew up playing sports.  I even played ice hockey, yes in Florida.  My education is nothing extraordinary, went to college (twice!) after high school because that's what your supposed to do, regardless of whether or not you are actually ready to be in college.  Perhaps my thoughts on higher education are for a future blog post....I have a bachelor's degree from the University of North Florida in Community Health.  What's that you might ask?  Long story....I also have an associates degree in Recording Arts from Full Sail University.  I know I know, huh?  I wanted to dj since the seventh grade (when I saw my first pair of real life SL-1200's!!) and dabbled with it some years later.  Music pushed me to forgo a nursing career (the whole B.S. in Community Health thing), which brings me to now...

I moved to my current city, Atlanta, Ga, back in 2010 and have been pursuing a career in the recording industry since.  These past few years have been the toughest I've experienced so far in my life, but also have taught me a great deal.  I've met some famous Atlanta artists as well as a famous French house DJ (ask me about a story involvoing food allergies and said dj).  As you might expect, getting a job in the music industry is not easy!  I work in the restaurant industry to pay the bills.

At the moment, I am in the process of a career change.  I am moving into the web development field in currently, I am attending The Iron Yard (learing Ruby on Rails) here in Atlanta.  After that, I'll keep you updated.  I would love an apprenticeship or mentorship after graduating!  I am super excited about this journey.  I've always loved tech and have used a computer since a young age.  Back then, computers were not very prevalent (fond memories of the Apple II go here...).  I was fortunate to attend an elementary school which had a big computer lab, and the Sega Genesis, Dreamcast, PS1 & 2, and Xbox 360 have been with me throughout!  Does that make me a jock/nerd?  I do love Star Trek and Star Wars, I even tried to play Magic at one point.

In short, I am a: newbie web developer, bartender, Liverpool FC fan (YNWA!!), reformed recording engineer, lover of tech, brother, uncle, introvert, Scorpio, gym rat!
